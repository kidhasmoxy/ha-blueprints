## Prerequisites

### Required Helper Entity
Create this input_select in your `configuration.yaml` or via the UI:

```yaml
input_select:
  home_mode:
    name: Home Mode
    options:
      - Away
      - Day
      - Evening
      - Night
    initial: Day
```

### Recommended Integrations
- **Motion Sensors**: Z-Wave JS, Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA
- **Contact Sensors**: Z-Wave JS, Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA
- **Button Devices**: Z-Wave JS, Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA, Philips Hue
- **Illuminance Sensors**: Any integration providing lux values

## Installation

1. Copy `room_lighting_advanced.yaml` to your Home Assistant `blueprints/automation/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant or reload automations
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Automations & Scenes ‚Üí Blueprints
4. Find "Advanced Room Lighting (Hubitat Style)" and create a new automation

## Configuration Guide

### Basic Setup
1. **Area Selection**: Select a Home Assistant Area to automatically populate the room name and enable area filtering
2. **Room Name Override**: Optionally override the area name with a custom room name
3. **Device Selection**: For each device type, you'll see two options:
   - **Area Filtered**: Shows only devices from the selected area (recommended)
   - **All Areas**: Shows devices from any area (for cross-room setups)
4. **Smart Combination**: The blueprint automatically combines your selections from both options

**Device Types Available**:
- **Light Groups (1-3)**: Organize lights into up to 3 groups with individual settings
- **Motion Sensors**: Motion detection devices
- **Contact Sensors**: Door/window sensors (optional)
- **Button Devices**: Buttons or switches for manual control (optional)
- **Alternative Turn-Off Devices**: Additional devices to turn off (TVs, fans, etc.)
- **Additional Sensors**: Illuminance, TV/media player, and sleep sensors

**Light Grouping Examples**:
- **Group 1**: Main ceiling lights (bright, cool white during day)
- **Group 2**: Accent/table lamps (dimmer, warm white)
- **Group 3**: Night lights (very dim, red/warm for nighttime)

**Usage Tip**: Most users will only need the area-filtered selectors. Use the "All Areas" selectors only when you need devices from other rooms (e.g., hallway motion sensor for bedroom lights).

### Activation Settings
- **Enable Motion Activation**: Turn on for motion-based lighting
- **Enable Contact Activation**: Turn on to activate when doors/windows open
- **Enable Button Activation**: Turn on for button/switch control
- **Illuminance Control**: Prevent activation during bright conditions

### Per-Group Per-Mode Light Settings
Configure different brightness and color temperature for each light group in each mode:

**Light Group 1 (Main Lights)**:
- **Away**: 30% brightness, 3000K (security lighting)
- **Day**: 75% brightness, 4000K (productive lighting)
- **Evening**: 85% brightness, 3000K (comfortable lighting)
- **Night**: 20% brightness, 2200K (minimal lighting)

**Light Group 2 (Accent Lights)**:
- **Away**: 20% brightness, 2700K (subtle presence)
- **Day**: 50% brightness, 3000K (ambient support)
- **Evening**: 70% brightness, 2700K (cozy atmosphere)
- **Night**: 10% brightness, 2200K (gentle accent)

**Light Group 3 (Night Lights)**:
- **Away**: Off (0% brightness)
- **Day**: Off (0% brightness)
- **Evening**: 30% brightness, 2200K (pathway lighting)
- **Night**: 5% brightness, 2000K (navigation lighting)

### Color Temperature (Optional)
Enable automatic color temperature adjustment:
- **Away**: 3000K (warm)
- **Day**: 4000K (neutral)
- **Evening**: 3000K (warm)
- **Night**: 2200K (very warm)

### Turn-Off Settings

- **Away Mode**: Quick timeout (default: 2 minutes)
- **Day Mode**: Standard timeout (default: 10 minutes)
- **Evening Mode**: Longer timeout (default: 15 minutes)
- **Night Mode**: Medium timeout (default: 5 minutes)

### Advanced Options
- **Require All Motion Clear**: All motion sensors must be inactive before turning off
- **Require Contact Closed**: Contact sensors must be closed before turning off
- **Prevent Motion Override**: Don't turn off lights after manual changes
- **Weekend Settings**: Use different timeouts on weekends
- **TV/Sleep Conditions**: Disable activation when TV is on or someone is sleeping

## Usage Examples

### Basic Motion Lighting with Area
```yaml
# Minimal configuration using Home Assistant Area
area_selector: living_room  # Select your Living Room area
# room_name will automatically be "Living Room" from the area
# Device selectors will be filtered to show only Living Room devices
enable_motion_activation: true
```

### Basic Motion Lighting (Manual)
```yaml
# Minimal configuration for simple motion lighting without area
room_name: "Living Room"
lights_to_control:
  entity_id: 
    - light.living_room_ceiling
    - light.living_room_lamp
motion_sensors:
  entity_id:
    - binary_sensor.living_room_motion
enable_motion_activation: true
```

### Advanced Multi-Sensor Setup with Area
```yaml
# Full-featured room using Home Assistant Area
area_selector: master_bedroom  # Select Master Bedroom area
room_name: "Master Bedroom"  # Optional override
# All device selectors will be filtered to Master Bedroom area
illuminance_sensor: sensor.bedroom_illuminance
enable_illuminance_control: true
illuminance_threshold: 30
disable_when_sleeping: true
sleep_sensor: input_boolean.bedroom_sleep_mode
enable_color_temp: true
require_all_motion_clear: true
enable_weekend_settings: true
weekend_timeout_multiplier: 2.0
```

## Events and Integration

The blueprint fires events that can be used by other automations:

### Events Fired
- `room_lighting_activated`: When lights are turned on
- `room_lighting_deactivated`: When lights are turned off

### Event Data
```yaml
# Activation event
event_type: room_lighting_activated
data:
  room: "Living Room"
  trigger: "motion"  # or "contact", "button"
  mode: "evening"
  brightness: 85

# Deactivation event
event_type: room_lighting_deactivated
data:
  room: "Living Room"
  trigger: "motion_timeout"
  timeout_minutes: 15
```

### Using Events in Other Automations
```yaml
# Example: Announce when room lighting activates
automation:
  - alias: "Announce Room Lighting"
    trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: room_lighting_activated
    action:
      - service: tts.speak
        data:
          message: "{{ trigger.event.data.room }} lights activated"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Enable Debug Logging
Set `enable_debug_logging: true` to see detailed logs in Home Assistant's log file.

### Common Issues
1. **Lights don't turn on**: Check illuminance threshold and TV/sleep conditions
2. **Lights don't turn off**: Verify motion sensor states and timeout settings
3. **Wrong brightness**: Check current mode in `input_select.home_mode`
4. **Color temperature not working**: Ensure lights support color temperature

### Log Messages
Look for messages starting with your room name in the Home Assistant logs:
```
Living Room: Motion detected, activating lights (Mode: evening, Brightness: 85%)
Living Room: Motion timeout (15 min), turning off lights
Living Room: Mode changed to night, adjusting lights
```
